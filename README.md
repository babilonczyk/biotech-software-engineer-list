## Why BioAI & Bioinformatics Matter

Modern biology generates enormous datasets — from DNA sequencing to protein structure predictions. **BioAI** applies **machine learning** to extract meaning from this data, accelerating:
- Drug discovery
- Genetic diagnostics
- Synthetic biology
- Personalized medicine

**Bioinformatics** provides the computational backbone for storing, processing, and analyzing biological data. Skilled engineers in this field are essential for turning raw data into scientific insights.
